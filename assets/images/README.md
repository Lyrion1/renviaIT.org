This folder is where you'll place your logo and favicon images.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

#### For the Favicon (the small icon that appears in browser tabs):
- **File name:** `favicon.ico` (or `favicon.png`)
- **Recommended size:** 32x32 pixels or 64x64 pixels
- **Supported formats:** .ico, .png
- **What it is:** The small icon that appears in the browser tab next to your website title

#### For the Logo (appears in the navigation bar):
- **File name:** `logo.png` (or `logo.svg` for best quality)
- **Recommended size:** Height of 40-50 pixels (width can be proportional)
- **Supported formats:** .png (with transparent background preferred), .svg, .jpg
- **What it is:** Your company logo that will appear in the top-left corner of every page

### Step 2: Upload Your Files

1. Go to GitHub and navigate to this folder: `assets/images/`
2. Click the "Add file" button and choose "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop or select your files:
   - Upload your favicon as: `favicon.ico` or `favicon.png`
   - Upload your logo as: `logo.png` or `logo.svg`
4. Click "Commit changes" at the bottom

### Step 3: That's It!

Once you upload the files with the correct names to this folder, they will automatically appear on your website:
